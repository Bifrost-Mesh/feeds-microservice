    # One side effect of virtual threads is that they are daemon threads. A JVM will exit if all of
    # its threads are daemon threads. This behavior can be a problem when you rely on @Scheduled
    # beans, for example, to keep your application alive. If you use virtual threads, the scheduler
    # thread is a virtual thread and therefore a daemon thread and wonâ€™t keep the JVM alive. This
    # not only affects scheduling and can be the case with other technologies too.
    # This ensures that the JVM is kept alive, even if all threads are virtual threads.
